# Contributing to TinyBaker

Thank you so much for contributing to TinyBaker! Contribution guidelines are small and short until this process becomes unteneble.

### Contribution Process
1. *(optional)* Open an issue describing your proposed change. If something involves an API change, I'd love to get a chance to take a look at the proposed API before you take the time to implement it.
2. Fork this repository.
3. Create your proposed changes on your forked version of the repository
4. *(if applicable)* Write tests. If you don't, that's totally fine too, but I do much prefer having tests.
5. Submit the Pull Request, and wait for me to either review or merge it!

No restrictions on things like description or commit messages. This project is not far along enough to make that matter much.
